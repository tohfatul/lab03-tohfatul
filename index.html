            <p>
                Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, 
                incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers.
                <br>
                We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the 
                tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WASP, and the major browser creators.
                <br>
                The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of 
                the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in 
                new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.

            <div class="article-header">SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</div>
            <p>
                There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to excite, 
                inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. 
                Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The HTML remains the same, 
                the only thing that has changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.
                <br>
                CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. 
                The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by 
                demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those 
                able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to 
                the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.

                Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, 
                so strong CSS skills are necessary too, but the example files are commented well 
                enough that even CSS novices can use them as starting points. Please see the CSS 
                Resource Guide for advanced tutorials and tips on working with CSS.
                <br>
                You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. 
                This may seem daunting at first if you’ve never worked this way before, but follow the 
                listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.
                <br>
                Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally. 
                Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) 
                upload your CSS file to a web server under your control. Send us a link to an archive of 
                that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and 
                place it on our server.

            <p>
                Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should be 
                limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. 
                The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical CSS and not the latest bleeding-edge 
                tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that 
                your CSS validates.
                <br>
                Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented CSS by now. When sticking 
                to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. 
                Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days — especially when you factor in 
                mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform. 
                That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and 
                the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).
                <br>
                We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. 
                Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and 
                interesting visual themes to your work. We’re well past the point of needing another 
                garden-related design.
