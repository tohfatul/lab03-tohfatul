            <div class="article-header">THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTMENT</div>
            <p>
                Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, 
                incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers.
                <br>
                We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the 
                tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WASP, and the major browser creators.
                <br>
                The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of 
                the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in 
                new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.

            </p>
            <br>
            <div class="article-header">SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</div>
            <p>
                There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to excite, 
                inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. 
                Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The HTML remains the same, 
                the only thing that has changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.
                <br>
                CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. 
                The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by 
                demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those 
                able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to 
                the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.

            <p>
                Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, 
                so strong CSS skills are necessary too, but the example files are commented well 
                enough that even CSS novices can use them as starting points. Please see the CSS 
                Resource Guide for advanced tutorials and tips on working with CSS.
                <br>
                You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. 
                This may seem daunting at first if you’ve never worked this way before, but follow the 
                listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.
                <br>
                Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally. 
                Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) 
                upload your CSS file to a web server under your control. Send us a link to an archive of 
                that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and 
                place it on our server.

                inspiration for those working on the web today, learning tool for those who will be
